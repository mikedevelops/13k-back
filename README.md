A reverse dungeon crawler from the perspective of the "other guy". For as long as we can remember we've smashed every pot, opened every chest, looted every loot, eaten every mushroom and jumped on every head. 

We do all this without a care in the world. We tell ourselves it's a necessary pleasure that begets more treasure.

This is not that story. This is about the aftermath of the gold rush. This is *our* story. We are not protagonists, we are the "other guys" and it's our job to put everything *back* the way it was.

We are not destined for an abbreviation on a leaderboard, and we do not see the credits roll. We operate in the shadows, in the dusty end of the memory on the brink of garbage collection. We are the garbage collection.

Time to clock on and put a shift in, these endless rogue-like-lites are coming and we are going to make sure you could eat your dinner off of each dungeon they encounter.
